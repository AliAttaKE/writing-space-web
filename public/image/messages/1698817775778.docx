tobacco products. 

Conclusion

	Tobacco use is one of the most influential public health threats in the world; therefore, taking effective preventive actions is essential. Taxation as a demand-side measure and controlling illicit trade are among the few methods to effectively discourage tobacco usage. Education contemplating the scope of this hazard and aimed at raising consciousness will aid create more informed consumers. Further initiatives such as stringent regulations pertaining to product packaging, promotion, and secondhand smoke exposure should also be adopted by member countries (Perrz-Warnisher et al., 2018). The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Treaty and its principles serve as invaluable tools for developing and implementing effective anti-smoking strategies.  Hence, closer collaboration between government officials, scientists, healthcare professionals, policy makers, nongovernmental bodies, and industry should be ensured through adherence to these critical components for smoking control policies. and taxation [60]. Curbing this trade will help reduce tobacco consumption by limiting the availability of more affordable alternatives to legally purchased cigarettes, thereby raising tobacco costs, which historically restricts usage (Perrz-Warnisher et al., 2018).

	The execution of anti-smoking laws has resulted in significant declines in secondhand smoke exposure. Scotland has experienced a particularly notable impact on non-smokers residing in non-smoking households, with average cotinine concentrations decreasing by 49% (World Health Organization, 2021). However, non-smokers living in smoking households observed only a minimal reduction. Implementing smoke-free housing policies could be an effective approach to diminish secondhand exposure in these individuals. A recent meta-analysis validated that anti-smoking legislation enacted between 1991 and 2010 led to a 12% reduction in hospitalizations globally due to acute coronary events (Perrz-Warnisher et al., 2018). Another meta-analysis published in 2012 confirmed that anti-smoking legislation in 33 countries lowered the risk of tobacco-related ailments, including cardiac, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases. Both studies revealed that more extensive laws correlated with higher risk reductions and long-term advantages (Perrz-Warnisher et al., 2018).

	Research on populations has shown that smoke-free regulations protect individuals from secondhand smoke, encourage quit attempts, support smoking cessation, and decrease cigarette smoking among adolescents and young adults (Apollonio et al., 2021). Our findings reinforce the effectiveness of a broad range of tobacco demand reduction policies in lowering smoking prevalence worldwide. However, they also highlight that despite significant progress, ample room for improvement exists, and efforts must be intensified and expedited to attain further gains in global health (Flor et al., 2021).

Obstacles to quitting smoking (refer to Iqbal et al., 2022)

	Four primary themes emerged as obstacles to smoking cessation (SmC). At the personal level, the most common barrier to SmC in the South Asian Region (SAR) literature is insufficient awareness about the dangers of cigarette smoking. Moreover, the absence of primary resources to support SmC, limited interest and motivation, associating smoking with specific situations, and reluctance to seek help for quitting all serve as significant obstacles to SmC interventions in SAR. Regarding policies, ineffective implementation and gaps in anti-smoking policies undermine the success of anti-smoking initiatives in SAR. In certain countries, single-stick cigarette sales face no restrictions. Concurrently, the strategies employed by the tobacco industry contribute to increased tobacco consumption. Even with bans on public smoking, numerous exceptions persist, as people smoke in non-air-conditioned cafes, eateries, hotels, airports, and other public areas in SAR. At the healthcare level, insufficient access, resource scarcity, role confusion, and a lack of enthusiasm among healthcare professionals (HCPs) concerning SmC are frequently observed barriers in SAR. Furthermore, social acceptance, motivation, pressure from social events, or parental smoking are common obstacles in SAR (Iqbal et al., 2022).

Promoters of smoking cessation

	Four key themes emerged as SmC promoters. At the individual level, awareness of smoking-related harm is the most prevalent facilitator of SmC interventions, which is further reinforced by the experience of smoking-related health issues such as respiratory or cardiovascular problems. The impact of mass media in raising awareness about tobacco risks is also recognized in SAR literature. Additionally, guilt over exposing others to secondhand smoke and the realization of setting an example for non-smokers can increase a smoker's intent to quit. Moreover, preparedness for SmC and strategies for managing withdrawal symptoms are essential facilitators of SmC. At the policy level, effectively implementing policies—particularly those related to tax increases, smoke-free spaces, health warnings, and graphic images—can significantly reduce cigarette smoking prevalence in SAR. While tobacco product sales are banned in Bhutan, Pakistan faces strict recommendations for implementing the MPOWER strategy and enforcing anti-smoking laws due to poor control over cigarette smoking prevalence. At the healthcare level, establishing anti-smoking facilitation centers, ensuring the availability of SmC-trained HCPs, and offering anti-smoking services to remote communities are crucial facilitators for SmC interventions in SAR. In Sri Lanka, community-level SmC approaches complement clinical support to reduce current cigarette smoking prevalence. At the sociocultural level in SAR, access to support systems such as family and friends, discussions about smoking risks in communities, and consideration of sociocultural values when developing anti-smoking policies are vital to controlling smoking prevalence (Iqbal et al., 2022).

Recommendations

Product Regulations and Potential Reduction of Harm

	Product regulations, which encompass rules about the types of products that can be sold, product information disclosure, product testing requirements, and mandatory performance standards for products, present new possibilities for mitigating the harm caused by cigarettes. In 2009, Congress passed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, granting the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect public health. However, the challenge lies in determining how to implement product regulations that effectively reduce cigarette harm without banning them (which is prohibited by law). The harm caused by cigarette smoking is evident due to addiction leading to prolonged exposure to carcinogens and other toxins in tobacco smoke, ultimately resulting in numerous cancers and tobacco-related illnesses. In principle, it should be possible to design tobacco products that are less addictive. For instance, regulating blending techniques, additives, and filters used in cigarettes to make them harder to inhale could significantly affect usage patterns. Reducing nicotine delivery could also help smokers quit more easily than current cigarettes. Nevertheless, whether such regulatory measures will ever be implemented remains uncertain (Paoletti et al., 2012).

Lung Cancer Screening: A Key Future Direction

	Another crucial future direction for medicine and public health involves lung cancer screening. The National Lung Screening Trial (NSLT) offers evidence supporting the use of low-dose CT scans for high-risk current and former cigarette smokers (over 55 years old with a > 30-pack-year smoking history) to detect cancers at an initial and treatable stage, thus reducing lung cancer mortality. The next decade presents an opportunity to dramatically change the lung cancer prognosis from a death sentence to a condition that can be detected early and effectively cured or managed. However, concerns about funding for screening and disease management costs may hinder efforts to capitalize on the potential of lung cancer screening for high-risk current and former smokers. In this situation, the government could make a wise decision by increasing tobacco taxes to deter young people from starting to smoke while allocating these tax revenues to aid addicted smokers in quitting and covering the costs of screening and disease management for those at risk of developing lung cancer (Paoletti et al., 2012).

Conclusion

	In conclusion, this research paper highlights the global health burden of tobacco consumption and the myriad health problems it causes. Despite significant progress in implementing anti-smoking policies and measures, much room remains for improvement. Challenges to smoking cessation include insufficient awareness of smoking-related harms, ineffective policy implementation, inadequate healthcare resources, and sociocultural factors. Promoters of smoking cessation encompass individual awareness, effective policy enforcement, healthcare system improvements, and sociocultural support systems. Future directions in tobacco control should focus on product regulations, the potential for harm reduction, and lung cancer screening for high-risk populations. By intensifying and expediting efforts in these areas, we can strive to make greater strides in global health by reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality.
