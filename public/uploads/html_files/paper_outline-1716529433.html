    <h1>The Impact of Global Warming on Our Planet</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Jane Doe</p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Global warming, defined as the long-term heating of Earthâ€™s climate system due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases, poses significant threats to the natural environment and human society. This essay explores the causes, effects, and potential mitigation strategies for global warming, employing a structured analysis of scientific data and trends. The urgency of addressing this global issue is emphasized through a discussion of its impacts on weather patterns, ecosystems, and global sea levels.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Global warming has become one of the most pressing environmental issues facing the planet today. The consistent rise in the Earth's average surface temperature is primarily attributed to the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as deforestation, burning fossil fuels, and industrial processes (<span class="citation">Smith, 2021</span>).</p>

    <h2>2. Causes of Global Warming</h2>
    <p>The main driver of global warming is the enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect due to the increased presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat from the sun's rays within the Earth's atmosphere, leading to higher temperatures (<span class="citation">Jones et al., 35</span>).</p>

    <h2>3. Effects of Global Warming</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Impact on Weather Patterns</h3>
    <p>Global warming has led to more extreme weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, and heavy rainfall. The intensification of these events can be directly linked to the increased energy in the climate system due to higher temperatures (<span class="citation">Williams, 78</span>).</p>
    <h3>3.2 Impact on Ecosystems</h3>
    <p>Rising temperatures have altered various ecosystems, leading to habitat degradation and the loss of biodiversity. Species unable to adapt to the rapid changes face extinction, disrupting ecological balance (<span class="citation">Brown and Zhang, 2022</span>).</p>
    <h3>3.3 Rising Sea Levels</h3>
    <p>The melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, coupled with the thermal expansion of seawater, has resulted in rising sea levels. This phenomenon threatens coastal communities and leads to the loss of coastal habitats (<span class="citation">Taylor, 90</span>).</p>

    <h2>4. Mitigation Strategies</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Renewable Energy</h3>
    <p>Transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can significantly reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, thereby decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases (<span class="citation">Johnson, 2023</span>).</p>
    <h3>4.2 Carbon Sequestration</h3>
    <p>Techniques such as afforestation and carbon capture and storage (CCS) can help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and mitigate the effects of global warming (<span class="citation">Davis and Lee, 130</span>).</p>
    <h3>4.3 International Cooperation</h3>
    <p>Global warming is a global issue that requires the cooperation of all nations. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to combat climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (<span class="citation">Robinson, 2024</span>).</p>

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The evidence presented highlights the severe implications of global warming and underscores the need for immediate action to mitigate its effects. While challenges remain, the implementation of effective mitigation strategies, with a focus on innovation and international cooperation, can pave the way for a sustainable future.</p>
