    <!-- Main Content -->
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. According to Smith and Jones (2020), the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes are major contributors to the rise in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.</p>

    <h2>Causes of Global Warming</h2>
    <p>The primary cause of global warming is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel combustion for energy production, transportation, and industry is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions. Deforestation and land-use changes also contribute significantly to global warming by reducing the planet's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide (Smith & Jones, 2020). Additionally, agricultural practices and waste management produce methane and nitrous oxide, which are potent greenhouse gases.</p>

    <h3>Greenhouse Gases</h3>
    <blockquote>Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect. This process is essential for maintaining a habitable climate, but excessive greenhouse gas concentrations can disrupt the balance and cause global temperatures to rise (Johnson, 2019).</blockquote>

    <h2>Impacts of Global Warming</h2>
    <p>Global warming has far-reaching impacts on the environment, human health, and economies. Rising temperatures lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and extreme weather events. Melting polar ice caps and glaciers contribute to sea-level rise, threatening coastal communities and ecosystems (Brown, 2018).</p>

    <h3>Environmental Impacts</h3>
    <p>The effects of global warming on ecosystems are profound. Many species are facing habitat loss and changing distribution patterns due to shifting climate zones. Coral reefs, which are highly sensitive to temperature changes, are experiencing widespread bleaching and mortality (Wilson, 2017).</p>

    <h3>Human Health and Economic Impacts</h3>
    <p>Human health is also at risk due to global warming. Increased temperatures can exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and the spread of infectious diseases is likely to expand into new regions (Smith & Jones, 2020). Economically, global warming can disrupt agriculture, fisheries, and tourism, leading to significant financial losses (Brown, 2018).</p>

    <h2>Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies</h2>
    <p>Addressing global warming requires a combination of mitigation and adaptation strategies. Mitigation involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks, while adaptation focuses on adjusting to the impacts of global warming.</p>

    <h3>Mitigation Strategies</h3>
    <p>Mitigation efforts include transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and implementing sustainable agricultural practices. Reforestation and afforestation projects can enhance carbon sequestration, while policies such as carbon pricing and emission reduction targets aim to limit greenhouse gas emissions (Johnson, 2019).</p>

    <h3>Adaptation Strategies</h3>
    <p>Adaptation strategies involve preparing for and managing the impacts of global warming. This includes building resilient infrastructure, developing early warning systems for extreme weather events, and promoting sustainable water management practices. Community-based adaptation approaches are crucial for enhancing the resilience of vulnerable populations (Wilson, 2017).</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Global warming is an urgent issue that requires immediate action to mitigate its effects and adapt to its impacts. By understanding the causes and consequences of global warming, and implementing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies, we can work towards a sustainable future. Continued research and policy development are essential for addressing this global challenge and ensuring the well-being of current and future generations.</p>
