        <h2>1. Age Eligibility and Registration Requirements</h2>
        <p>The Writing Space platform and services are available to all users aged 13 years or older. By registering an account or using our services, you confirm that you meet this minimum age requirement. We do not require parental consent for users between 13-17 years of age, though we reserve the right to verify user age through appropriate documentation when necessary. Users under 16 residing in jurisdictions requiring parental consent under laws such as the GDPR must provide verifiable parental approval prior to using our services. For users aged 16-17, parental consent is recommended but not mandatory unless required by local regulations. All users under 13 years old are strictly prohibited from accessing or using our services in any capacity.</p>
        <h2>2. Customer Support Availability and Response Times</h2>
        <p>Writing Space provides comprehensive customer support through multiple channels with varying availability. Email support operates on a 24/7 basis, with our team committed to responding to all email inquiries within 6-8 hours of receipt. For immediate assistance, live chat support is available daily from 9 AM to 5 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST). Please note that we no longer offer telephone support services. During peak periods, response times may be slightly extended, though we strive to address all urgent matters promptly.</p>
    <h2>3. Comprehensive Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>All refund requests are subject to the following terms and conditions. Approved refunds will be processed within a maximum period of 45 days from the date of approval. Please be advised that refunds are absolutely unavailable under the following circumstances:</p>
    <p>For bulk or prepaid package purchases, no refunds will be issued once payment has been processed. </p>
    <p>Orders where work has been partially delivered or where the assigned Principal has commenced work on your project are ineligible for refunds. </p>
    <p>Our amendment policy allows for free revisions within 7 days of delivery; any requests made after this period cannot form the basis for a refund claim.</p>
    <p>Refund eligibility is further restricted in cases where delivery delays result from customer actions, including but not limited to: failure to pay outstanding balances, delayed responses to information requests, or provision of unclear or contradictory initial instructions. However, for delays caused by Writing Space, customers may qualify for discounts on future orders at our discretion.</p>
<P>We cannot process refunds for dissatisfaction with grades or marks received when using our materials as reference, as these outcomes depend on numerous external factors beyond our control.</P>
<h2>4. Operational Days and Service Interruptions</h2>
<p>Our business operations and service delivery follow a standard schedule, excluding designated Non-Working Days which include: Bank Holidays, Christmas Day (December 25), Boxing Day (December 26), and New Year's Day (January 1). The Company reserves the right to designate additional Non-Working Days as necessary, with such dates being communicated to users through prominent notices on our website. All delivery deadlines affected by Non-Working Days will automatically extend to the next business day.</p>
<h2>5. Jurisdiction and Governing Law</h2>
<p>Writing Space is legally domiciled in Pakistan, and this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Pakistani law. Any disputes arising from or related to these Terms and Conditions, or the services provided hereunder, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Pakistan. Users expressly consent to this jurisdictional provision as a condition of using our services.</p>
<h2>6. Data Control and Privacy Management</h2>
<p>Writing Space serves as the primary data controller for all user information collected through our platform. We engage various third-party service providers who act as data processors under our direction. A comprehensive list of these third-party processors, including but not limited to: Turnitin (plagiarism verification), Google Analytics (usage tracking), Mastercard (payments), Twilio/Esendex (SMS), Hostinger (cloud storage), and WeTransfer (file sharing).</p>
<h2>7. Service Limitations and User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>By using our services, you acknowledge and agree that all materials provided are intended solely for research and reference purposes. The Company cannot guarantee specific academic outcomes or results from using our services. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their use of our materials complies with their educational institution's academic integrity policies. We expressly disclaim liability for any improper, unauthorized, or unethical use of the materials we provide. Termination for copyright violations follows the specific procedures outlined in our Copyright Policyâ€™s Repeat Infringer Policy, which supersedes general termination rights in cases of intellectual property infringement. While we primarily use Turnitin for plagiarism verification, equivalent reports from certified alternative systems will be provided if Turnitin becomes temporarily unavailable.</p>
<h2>8. Amendments to Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>Writing Space reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. Continued use of our services following such modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. Users are responsible for regularly reviewing the most current version of this document, available on our website.  </p>
<h2>9. General Provisions</h2>
<p>These Terms and Conditions represent the entire agreement between Writing Space and its users, superseding all prior agreements or understandings. If any provision is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force. Our failure to enforce any right or provision shall not constitute a waiver of such right unless acknowledged in writing.</p>
<h2>10. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By accessing or using Writing Space's services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms and Conditions in their entirety. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must immediately discontinue use of our services.</p>
